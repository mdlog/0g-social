# Overview

0G Social is a fully decentralized, on-chain social media platform where users truly own their data and AI feeds. Built on 0G Chain infrastructure, the platform implements:

- **On-chain Content Storage**: All posts, images, videos, and threads stored on 0G Storage
- **User-owned AI Feeds**: Personal AI algorithms running on 0G Compute, owned by users not the platform
- **Transparent Data Availability**: All interactions (likes, comments, reposts) recorded on 0G DA and verified on 0G Chain
- **No Corporate Algorithm Control**: Users control their own feed algorithms, eliminating hidden corporate manipulation

This represents a paradigm shift from traditional social media to truly decentralized, user-controlled social networking.

# Recent Changes

## Enhanced 0G Storage Error Handling & Retry System (August 19, 2025)
- **Issue**: False "insufficient funds" errors appearing even when users had adequate 0G token balance
- **Root Cause**: Error detection logic was too generic, classifying network/service errors as balance issues
- **Solution**: Comprehensive error detection refinement and retry system
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **Accurate Error Classification**: Fixed detection to distinguish network vs balance vs service errors
  - **Smart Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry (2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s delays)
  - **Manual Retry Buttons**: User-controlled "Retry now" buttons for immediate retry attempts
  - **Enhanced User Feedback**: Specific error messages with targeted solutions
  - **Faucet Integration**: Direct 0G faucet links only for genuine balance issues
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Error types: `network_error` (retryable), `insufficient_funds` (non-retryable), `service_error` (retryable)
  - Network errors: ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT, 503, 502, timeouts (retryable)
  - Balance errors: Only genuine blockchain gas/balance issues (non-retryable)  
  - Service errors: 0G Storage specific errors like "Data already exists" (retryable)
  - Manual retry endpoint: `/api/posts/:id/retry-storage` for user control
- **User Experience**: No more false balance warnings, accurate error reporting, user control over retries

# Recent Changes

## Post Count Display Fix (August 19, 2025)
