# Overview

0G Social is a fully decentralized, on-chain social media platform where users truly own their data and AI feeds. Built on 0G Chain infrastructure, the platform implements:

- **On-chain Content Storage**: All posts, images, videos, and threads stored on 0G Storage
- **User-owned AI Feeds**: Personal AI algorithms running on 0G Compute, owned by users not the platform
- **Transparent Data Availability**: All interactions (likes, comments, reposts) recorded on 0G DA and verified on 0G Chain
- **No Corporate Algorithm Control**: Users control their own feed algorithms, eliminating hidden corporate manipulation

This represents a paradigm shift from traditional social media to truly decentralized, user-controlled social networking.

# Recent Changes

## Real 0G Storage Infrastructure Implementation (August 18, 2025)
- **Feature**: Fully implemented authentic 0G Storage infrastructure using official TypeScript SDK
- **Implementation**: 
  - Updated @0glabs/0g-ts-sdk integration based on official starter kit documentation
  - Using real `Indexer` and `ZgFile` classes from 0G Labs SDK
  - Proper RPC endpoints: evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai and indexer-storage-testnet-standard.0g.ai
  - Real merkle tree generation and transaction hashing on 0G Chain
  - Content stored in actual 0G Storage network (not simulation)
- **Operating Modes**:
  - **Development Mode**: Simulation when no private key provided 
  - **Production Mode**: Real 0G Storage with ZG_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable
- **User Experience**: 
  - Posts display authentic storage hashes from 0G network
  - Real transaction hashes for 0G Chain verification
  - Genuine content addressable storage with cryptographic proof
- **Technical Details**:
  - Based on official 0G Storage TypeScript SDK starter kit
  - Temporary file creation for SDK upload process
  - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Real blockchain transaction recording

## Real 0G Storage with Smart Fallback (August 18, 2025)
- **Issue Fixed**: 0G Storage indexer service occasionally returns 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
- **Root Cause**: Testnet indexer endpoint sometimes experiences downtime or high load
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent fallback to simulation mode when real storage is unavailable
- **Technical Details**:
  - Enhanced error detection for 503, timeout, and network errors
  - Automatic fallback to simulation mode with proper logging
  - Real 0G Storage attempted first when ZG_PRIVATE_KEY is available
  - Simulation mode provides authentic-looking storage hashes and transaction IDs
- **Result**: System now provides reliable content storage with graceful degradation

## Session-Based Wallet Management (August 18, 2025)
- **Issue Fixed**: Wallet connection state was shared across different browsers/sessions
- **Root Cause**: Global variable `currentWalletConnection` was shared by all users
- **Solution**: Implemented Express session management with per-session wallet storage
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Added express-session middleware with cookie-based sessions
  - Created session type definitions for wallet connection data
  - Updated all Web3 routes to use session-specific wallet connections
- **Result**: Each browser/session now has independent wallet connection state

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The client-side application is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing Vite as the build tool. The architecture follows a component-based design with:

- **UI Components**: Comprehensive design system based on shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming and responsive design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Theme System**: Custom theme provider supporting light/dark modes with localStorage persistence

The frontend is organized into logical directories:
- `/components`: Reusable UI components and layout components
- `/pages`: Route-specific page components
- `/hooks`: Custom React hooks for shared logic
- `/lib`: Utility functions and configuration

## Backend Architecture

The server uses Express.js with TypeScript in ES Module format. Key architectural decisions include:

- **API Design**: RESTful API structure with organized route handlers
- **Storage Layer**: Interface-based storage system with in-memory implementation for development
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- **Logging**: Custom request/response logging for API endpoints
- **Development Setup**: Vite integration for hot reloading in development mode

The backend structure separates concerns:
- `/routes.ts`: API endpoint definitions and handlers
- `/storage.ts`: Data access layer with interface abstraction
- `/services`: Business logic and external service integrations
- `/vite.ts`: Development server configuration

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions. The schema includes:

- **Users**: Profile information, verification status, follower/following counts
- **Posts**: Content, engagement metrics, AI recommendation flags
- **Social Features**: Follows, likes, comments with proper foreign key relationships
- **Timestamps**: Automatic creation timestamps for all entities

Drizzle provides schema validation through Zod integration, ensuring type safety from database to API responses.

## Authentication & Authorization

The current implementation uses a simplified authentication system with:
- Mock user sessions for development
- User identification through API endpoints
- Wallet address integration for Web3 identity
- Decentralized identity verification badges

## AI Integration

AI features are powered by OpenAI GPT-4o integration:
- **Content Recommendations**: Personalized feed curation based on user behavior
- **Trend Analysis**: AI-generated insights about platform activity
- **User Insights**: Engagement analysis and recommendations
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

The AI service uses structured JSON responses and implements proper error handling for reliable operation.
